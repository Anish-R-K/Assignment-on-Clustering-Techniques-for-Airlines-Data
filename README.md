# Assignment-on-Clustering-Techniques-for-Airlines-Data

The file EastWestAirlinescontains information on passengers who belong to an airlineâ€™s frequent flier program. For each passenger the data include information on their mileage history and on different ways they accrued or spent miles in the last year. The goal is to try to identify clusters of passengers that have similar characteristics for the purpose of targeting different segments for different types of mileage offers.


Perform **Hierarchical** and **K means** clustering clustering techniques for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters and draw the inferences from the clusters obtained.
